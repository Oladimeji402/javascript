    <p>Mark and John want to compare their Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass /
        heightÂ² = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meters).</p>

    <p>1. Assign the mass and height of Mark and John to variables.</p>

    <p>2. Compute their BMIs using the formula (you can implement both variations).</p>

    <p>3. Define a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' to indicate whether Mark's BMI is higher than John's.</p>

    <p> TEST DATA 1: Mark weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. </p>

    <p> TEST DATA 2: Mark weighs 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weighs 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall. </p>
